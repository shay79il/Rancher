Security Assertion Markup Language

    SAML SSO: SAML is an authentication protocol used to confirm digital identities for accessing SaaS applications. Rather than share credentials, SAML enables the communication between identity providers and service providers using secure tokens (encrypted, digitally signed XML-certificates). This allows users to access multiple applications with trusted information and—by implementing single sign-on—to only log in once.
